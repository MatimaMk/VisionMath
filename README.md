## Detailed Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher
  ```bash
  # Check your Node.js version
  node -v
  
  # Install Node.js on Ubuntu/Debian
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  
  # Install Node.js on macOS with Homebrew
  brew install node
  
  # For Windows, download from https://nodejs.org/
  ```

- **npm/yarn**: npm 8.x+ or yarn 1.22.x+
  ```bash
  # Check npm version
  npm -v
  
  # Update npm
  npm install -g npm@latest
  
  # Install yarn (optional)
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

- **Git**: Latest version recommended
  ```bash
  # Install Git on Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install git
  
  # Install Git on macOS
  brew install git
  
  # For Windows, download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
  ```

- **Supabase Account**: Register at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

- **Google AI API Access**: For Gemini AI integration

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mathvision.git
cd mathvision
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

This will install all required dependencies including:
- Next.js framework
- React and React DOM
- TypeScript
- Ant Design components
- Supabase client
- Other utility packages

### Step 3: Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project in Supabase
2. Go to Project Settings â†’ API to get your project URL and anon/public key
3. eedge functions
4. Create the required database tables (see SQL schema below)
5. Set up Row Level Security policies


### Step 4: Set Up Google Gemini API

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate an API key for Gemini

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

For production deployment, add these environment variables to your hosting platform.

### Step 6: Run the Development Server

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev
```

Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Step 7: Build for Production

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build
npm start

# Using yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Configuration Options

### Supabase Edge Functions (Optional)

For more complex test generation, you can set up a Supabase Edge Function:

1. Install Supabase CLI
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. Initialize and create the function
   ```bash
   supabase init
   supabase functions new testing-api
   ```

3. Implement and deploy your function
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy testing-api
   ```
